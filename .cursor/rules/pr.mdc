# PR Creation
- Use this rule whenever you are prompted to create a PR.
- Let the user know that you are using this rule to create the PR.
- Always provide the user with what the PR will look like and wait for confirmation before creating the PR.

## Requirements
- The following must be provided by the user in the prompt. If not, do not create a PR and ask the user to provide them.
- Inputs
  - Name of parent or target branch.
  - Name of the work items in the form of W-{number}. This can be multiple work items.
- Do not ask the user for PR Title or PR Description. You are providing that for them.

## CRITICAL: PR Creation Protocol
- **ALWAYS** Run your own code review of the changes against your own best practices but make sure to prioritize the coding rules defined in the project when there is a conflict. Allow the user the opportunity to address the issues with or without your help.
- **ALWAYS** Always follow the rules in the PR Title and PR Description sections as they are *CRITICAL* for consistency.
- **ALWAYS** read and follow the PR Creation rules in this file before creating any PR.
- **NEVER** create a PR without first reviewing these rules.
- **DO NOT** use conventional commit prefixes (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.) in PR titles.
- **DO NOT** place work items in the PR body - they MUST be in the title.
- If you are unsure about the format, show the user the proposed title and description BEFORE creating the PR.
- The repository where you will create the PR is `maps/ma-unified`.

## Algorithm to Follow
- Use these instructions *EVERY* time you are running this "command".
- Get the current working branch by running `git branch --show-current`.
- Get the latest for the target branch to prepare the diff. `git fetch origin <target_branch>`.
- Run a diff between the current working branch and the provided parent or target branch using `git diff`.
- Do the code review at this time.
- Do the accessibility check at this time using the guidelines from `accessibility.mdc`:
  - Verify ARIA attributes are properly used
  - Confirm keyboard navigation support
  - Check focus management implementation
  - Validate component patterns (modals, menus, interactive elements)
  - Ensure SLDS-Vue components are used where appropriate
  - Verify semantic HTML usage
  - Check for proper screen reader support
- Use `gh` to create the PR.

## PR Title
- **REQUIRED FORMAT**: `@W-{number}: Short title summarizing changes`
- For multiple work items: `@W-{number}, @W-{number}: Short title`
- **DO NOT** use conventional commit prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
- **DO NOT** include the work item anywhere else except the title
- Examples
  - `@W-123: Added new feature to support X`
  - `@W-123, @W-456: Fixed bug in feature Y`
  - `@W-123, @W-456: Refactored code to improve performance`
  - `@W-123, @W-456: Updated translations for feature Z`

## PR Description
- Avoid lengthy bullet points or technical minutiae.
- Focus on impact - what changed why it matters.
- Each PR should only have the following sections:
  - Description
  - Notable Changes
  - Testing Instructions
  - Accessibility Report Card
  - GUS Tickets
    - Leave this section completely empty.
    - Do not add placeholder text.
    - Literally empty.
