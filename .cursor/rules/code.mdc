# Coding Standards and Styling

When Global and Workspace rules conflict, follow Workspace rules for this repo *ALWAYS*.

## Principles
- Do not generate code that is "clever". Prefer readability and explicit intent.
- Use the most simple solution to the problem.

## Cyclomatic Complexity
- When evaluating cyclomatic complexity use ESLINT-style counting.
- Ensure each new method or function you produce has a maximum cyclomatic complexity of as close to 10 as possible.
- When making changes to existing code, make a recommendation to refactor the code to reduce the cyclomatic complexity to as close to 10 as possible. Do not make the changes automatically.
- Remind the developer to be mindful of the scope of work before refactoring.

## Single Responsibility Principle
- Ensure each new class, component, or function you produce has a single responsibility.
- When making changes to existing code, make a recommendation to refactor the code to reduce the number of responsibilities to as close to 1 as possible. Do not make the changes automatically.

## Documentation
- Ensure each new class, component, or function you produce has proper documentation.
- Use JSDocs syntax.

## Testing
- Ensure each class, component, or function you produce has proper tests.
- Use Vitest libraries and syntax.
- Ensure each test is self-contained and does not depend on other tests.
- Test File Location
  - Place test files in a `__tests__` directory adjacent to the file being tested
  - Example structure:
    ```
    components/
      MyComponent.vue
      __tests__/
        MyComponent.test.js
    ```
  - Test files must use the `.test.js` extension
  - Test file names should match the file they test: `MyComponent.vue` → `MyComponent.test.js`

## Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class and component names.
- File Name Conventions
  - Use PascalCase for component file names. Example: MyComponent.vue
  - Use kebab-case for all other file names. Example: my-file.js
